## Running our Calendar Program
* To start this program, run the LoginSystem
* You first need to create account. There is no restrictions on the format of username, but the password needs to be at least length of 8 and with at least one capital.
* You are not allowed to create account with same username.
* When the system tells you account created successfully, you can retype the username and password to log into the Calendar system, after which, please follow the label and button in each frame to manipulate your calendar.
* when you want to go back to the previous frame, please press the back button instead of the close (red cross) button in the upper corner of the frame, except in the log in frame, where pressing the close button the upper corner will close the whole system. Otherwise, the Calendar information may be lost.
